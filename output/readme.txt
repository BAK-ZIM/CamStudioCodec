Copyright 2003 RenderSoft Software

* CamStudio Lossless Codec is a very fast codec optimized for screen capture applications.
* It operates in RGB mode and is able to compress 16, 24 or 32 bit RGB bitmaps.
* It supports temporal compression and is able to render the movies with perfect quality. 
* A application that work nicely this codec is the CamStudio Screen Recorder. This can be downloaded at

* CamStudio codec is able to compress using two lossless compression algorithms : LZO and GZIP.
* The LZO algorithm is very fast and is best used for screen capturing.

* The GZIP (zlib) algorithm is most useful when you are converting / recompressing an existing AVI file with CamStudio codec.
The small file size produced with the GZIP (zlib) algorithm makes it ideal for archiving purposes.
When encoding with a third party application, you will have to enable / force keyframes to take advantage of this codec's temporal compression. 
Otherwise every frame will be stored as a key frame and the resulting file size will be very big.

* The source code for this codec is available at http://www.rendersoftware.com/products/camstudio/codecs.htm
and is released under the GNU General Public License, v2. The code is for Visual C++ 5.0 / 6.0.

* This codec is based on the LZO compression library by Markus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumer, 
zlib compression library by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler, 
and the HUFFYUV codec by Ben Rudiak-Gould.

* Bugs and limitations :

This codec may display some artifacts when it is played with CamStudio Player 2.0/2.1 in some systems.

These artifacts do not appear when it is used with Windows Media Player or other well-known AVI players.
